# MuralLoss: Combined Loss for Mural Restoration

This project implements a custom loss function **MuralLoss**, designed for mural restoration tasks.  
It combines multiple complementary components to balance pixel-level accuracy, structural fidelity, perceptual similarity, and fine details.

## üìå Loss Components

### 1. L1 Loss
- Ensures pixel-wise accuracy (color and brightness consistency).  
- Widely used as a baseline in image restoration.  

### 2. SSIM Loss
- Measures **structural similarity** between restored and ground-truth images.  
- More consistent with human visual perception compared to L1/MSE.  
- Formula:  
  ![SSIM Formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?SSIM(x,y)=\frac{(2\mu_x\mu_y+C_1)(2\sigma_{xy}+C_2)}{(\mu_x^2+\mu_y^2+C_1)(\sigma_x^2+\sigma_y^2+C_2)})  

  (Plain text version for GitHub preview:)  
  `SSIM(x,y) = ((2 * Œºx * Œºy + C1) * (2 * œÉxy + C2)) / ((Œºx^2 + Œºy^2 + C1) * (œÉx^2 + œÉy^2 + C2))`

### 3. Perceptual Loss
- Uses deep feature maps (e.g., VGG) to measure semantic and perceptual similarity.  
- Encourages the restored mural to preserve high-level content and style.

### 4. Edge-aware Loss
- Extracts edges via Sobel filters and minimizes their difference.  
- Ensures sharper edges, textures, and cracks ‚Äî critical for mural restoration.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Total Loss

The final loss is a weighted combination:

![Total Loss](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\mathcal{L}_{total}=\lambda_1\mathcal{L}_{L1}+\lambda_2\mathcal{L}_{SSIM}+\lambda_3\mathcal{L}_{Perceptual}+\lambda_4\mathcal{L}_{Edge})

(Plain text version:)  
`L_total = Œª1 * L1 + Œª2 * L_SSIM + Œª3 * L_Perceptual + Œª4 * L_Edge`


Default weights:
- `l1_weight = 1.0`  
- `ssim_weight = 0.5`  
- `perceptual_weight = 0.1`  
- `edge_weight = 0.2`

## üñºÔ∏è Why MuralLoss?

- **L1**: keeps global colors accurate  
- **SSIM**: preserves structure  
- **Perceptual**: maintains semantic meaning  
- **Edge-aware**: enhances fine details  

This makes it especially suitable for **mural restoration**, where both **visual fidelity** and **structural consistency** are crucial.
